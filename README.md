# Build

SXSEXP comes with full source code written in C.
In order to build from source you need Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and later versions.

# Newest MsDelta changes

Since apprx. Windows 11 MS introduced updated version of MsDelta compression library that comes as part of cumulative update. This library called "UpdateCompression.dll" 
and it is a new version of Windows built-in MsDelta.dll with (besides of other improvements) only support to in-memory operations compared to old MsDelta.dll that can also work directly with files.

If you are having trouble with expanding files try using updatecompression.dll instead of default msdelta.dll. Simple rename updatecompression.dll to msdelta.dll and drop it to
the same directory where sxsexp located. See [#6](https://github.com/hfiref0x/SXSEXP/issues/6) for more information.
